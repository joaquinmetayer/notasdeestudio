/* JavaScript is a scripting language you can use to make web pages interactive. It is one of the core technologies of the web, along with HTML and CSS, and is supported by all modern browsers.

In this course, you'll learn fundamental programming concepts in JavaScript. You'll start with basic data structures like numbers and strings. Then you'll learn to work with arrays, objects, functions, loops, if/else statements, and more.

----------------------------
Comment Your JavaScript Code
Comments are lines of code that JavaScript will intentionally ignore. Comments are a great way to leave notes to yourself and to other people who will later need to figure out what that code does.

There are two ways to write comments in JavaScript:

Using // will tell JavaScript to ignore the remainder of the text on the current line. This is an in-line comment:

// This is an in-line comment.
You can make a multi-line comment beginning with /* and ending with */. This is a multi-line comment:

/* This is a
multi-line comment */
/* NOTE: As you write code, you should regularly add comments to clarify the function of parts of your code. Good commenting can help communicate the intent of your code—both for others and for your future self.

----------------------------
Declare JavaScript Variables
In computer science, data is anything that is meaningful to the computer. JavaScript provides eight different data types which are undefined, null, boolean, string, symbol, bigint, number, and object.

For example, computers distinguish between numbers, such as the number 12, and strings, such as "12", "dog", or "123 cats", which are collections of characters. Computers can perform mathematical operations on a number, but not on a string.

Variables allow computers to store and manipulate data in a dynamic fashion. They do this by using a "label" to point to the data rather than using the data itself. Any of the eight data types may be stored in a variable.

Variables are similar to the x and y variables you use in mathematics, which means they're a simple name to represent the data we want to refer to. Computer variables differ from mathematical variables in that they can store different values at different times.

We tell JavaScript to create or declare a variable by putting the keyword var in front of it, like so:

var ourName;
creates a variable called ourName. In JavaScript we end statements with semicolons. Variable names can be made up of numbers, letters, and $ or _, but may not contain spaces or start with a number.

----------------------------
Storing Values with the Assignment Operator
In JavaScript, you can store a value in a variable with the assignment operator (=).

myVariable = 5;
This assigns the Number value 5 to myVariable.

If there are any calculations to the right of the = operator, those are performed before the value is assigned to the variable on the left of the operator.

var myVar;
myVar = 5;
First, this code creates a variable named myVar. Then, the code assigns 5 to myVar. Now, if myVar appears again in the code, the program will treat it as if it is 5.

----------------------------------------------
Assigning the Value of One Variable to Another
After a value is assigned to a variable using the assignment operator, you can assign the value of that variable to another variable using the assignment operator.

var myVar;
myVar = 5;
var myNum;
myNum = myVar;
The above declares a myVar variable with no value, then assigns it the value 5. Next, a variable named myNum is declared with no value. Then, the contents of myVar (which is 5) is assigned to the variable myNum. Now, myNum also has the value of 5.

---------------------------------------------------
Initializing Variables with the Assignment Operator
It is common to initialize a variable to an initial value in the same line as it is declared.

var myVar = 0;
Creates a new variable called myVar and assigns it an initial value of 0.

------------------------
Declare String Variables
Previously you used the following code to declare a variable:

var myName;
But you can also declare a string variable like this:

var myName = "your name";
"your name" is called a string literal. A string literal, or string, is a series of zero or more characters enclosed in single or double quotes.

-------------------------------------
Understanding Uninitialized Variables
When JavaScript variables are declared, they have an initial value of undefined. If you do a mathematical operation on an undefined variable your result will be NaN which means "Not a Number". If you concatenate a string with an undefined variable, you will get a string of undefined.

------------------------------------------
Understanding Case Sensitivity in Variables
In JavaScript all variables and function names are case sensitive. This means that capitalization matters.

MYVAR is not the same as MyVar nor myvar. It is possible to have multiple distinct variables with the same name but different casing. It is strongly recommended that for the sake of clarity, you do not use this language feature.

Best Practice

Write variable names in JavaScript in camelCase. In camelCase, multi-word variable names have the first word in lowercase and the first letter of each subsequent word is capitalized.

Examples:

var someVariable;
var anotherVariableName;
var thisVariableNameIsSoLong;

---------------------------------------------------
Explore Differences Between the var and let Keywords
One of the biggest problems with declaring variables with the var keyword is that you can easily overwrite variable declarations:

var camper = "James";
var camper = "David";
console.log(camper);
In the code above, the camper variable is originally declared as James, and is then overridden to be David. The console then displays the string David.

In a small application, you might not run into this type of problem. But as your codebase becomes larger, you might accidentally overwrite a variable that you did not intend to. Because this behavior does not throw an error, searching for and fixing bugs becomes more difficult.

A keyword called let was introduced in ES6, a major update to JavaScript, to solve this potential issue with the var keyword. You'll learn about other ES6 features in later challenges.

If you replace var with let in the code above, it results in an error:

let camper = "James";
let camper = "David";
The error can be seen in your browser console.

So unlike var, when you use let, a variable with the same name can only be declared once.

---------------------------------------------------
Declare a Read-Only Variable with the const Keyword
The keyword let is not the only new way to declare variables. In ES6, you can also declare variables using the const keyword.

const has all the awesome features that let has, with the added bonus that variables declared using const are read-only. They are a constant value, which means that once a variable is assigned with const, it cannot be reassigned:

const FAV_PET = "Cats";
FAV_PET = "Dogs";
The console will display an error due to reassigning the value of FAV_PET.

You should always name variables you don't want to reassign using the const keyword. This helps when you accidentally attempt to reassign a variable that is meant to stay constant.

Note: It is common for developers to use uppercase variable identifiers for immutable values and lowercase or camelCase for mutable values (objects and arrays). You will learn more about objects, arrays, and immutable and mutable values in later challenges. Also in later challenges, you will see examples of uppercase, lowercase, or camelCase variable identifiers.

-------------------------------
Add Two Numbers with JavaScript
Number is a data type in JavaScript which represents numeric data.

Now let's try to add two numbers using JavaScript.

JavaScript uses the + symbol as an addition operator when placed between two numbers.

Example:

const myVar = 5 + 10;
myVar now has the value 15.

------------------------------------------------
Subtract One Number from Another with JavaScript
We can also subtract one number from another.

JavaScript uses the - symbol for subtraction.

Example

const myVar = 12 - 6;
myVar would have the value 6.

------------------------------------
Multiply Two Numbers with JavaScript
We can also multiply one number by another.

JavaScript uses the * symbol for multiplication of two numbers.

Example

const myVar = 13 * 13;
myVar would have the value 169.

--------------------------------------------
Divide One Number by Another with JavaScript
We can also divide one number by another.

JavaScript uses the / symbol for division.

Example

const myVar = 16 / 2;
myVar now has the value 8.

----------------------------------
Increment a Number with JavaScript
You can easily increment or add one to a variable with the ++ operator.

i++;
is the equivalent of

i = i + 1;
Note: The entire line becomes i++;, eliminating the need for the equal sign.

----------------------------------
Decrement a Number with JavaScript
You can easily decrement or decrease a variable by one with the -- operator.

i--;
is the equivalent of

i = i - 1;
Note: The entire line becomes i--;, eliminating the need for the equal sign.

--------------------------------------
Create Decimal Numbers with JavaScript
We can store decimal numbers in variables too. Decimal numbers are sometimes referred to as floating point numbers or floats.

Note: when you compute numbers, they are computed with finite precision. Operations using floating points may lead to different results than the desired outcome. If you are getting one of these results, open a topic on the freeCodeCamp forum.

-------------------------------------
Multiply Two Decimals with JavaScript
In JavaScript, you can also perform calculations with decimal numbers, just like whole numbers.

Let's multiply two decimals together to get their product.

---------------------------------------------
Divide One Decimal by Another with JavaScript
Now let's divide one decimal by another.

---------------------------------
Finding a Remainder in JavaScript
The remainder operator % gives the remainder of the division of two numbers.

Example

5 % 2 = 1 because
Math.floor(5 / 2) = 2 (Quotient)
2 * 2 = 4
5 - 4 = 1 (Remainder)
Usage
In mathematics, a number can be checked to be even or odd by checking the remainder of the division of the number by 2.

17 % 2 = 1 (17 is Odd)
48 % 2 = 0 (48 is Even)
Note: The remainder operator is sometimes incorrectly referred to as the modulus operator. It is very similar to modulus, but does not work properly with negative numbers.


-------------------------------------------
Compound Assignment With Augmented Addition
In programming, it is common to use assignments to modify the contents of a variable. Remember that everything to the right of the equals sign is evaluated first, so we can say:

myVar = myVar + 5;
to add 5 to myVar. Since this is such a common pattern, there are operators which do both a mathematical operation and assignment in one step.

One such operator is the += operator.

let myVar = 1;
myVar += 5;
console.log(myVar);
6 would be displayed in the console.

----------------------------------------------
Compound Assignment With Augmented Subtraction
Like the += operator, -= subtracts a number from a variable.

myVar = myVar - 5;
will subtract 5 from myVar. This can be rewritten as:

myVar -= 5;

------------------------------------------------
Compound Assignment With Augmented Multiplication
The *= operator multiplies a variable by a number.

myVar = myVar * 5;
will multiply myVar by 5. This can be rewritten as:

myVar *= 5;

-------------------------------------------
Compound Assignment With Augmented Division
The /= operator divides a variable by another number.

myVar = myVar / 5;
Will divide myVar by 5. This can be rewritten as:

myVar /= 5;

----------------------------------
Escaping Literal Quotes in Strings
When you are defining a string you must start and end with a single or double quote. What happens when you need a literal quote: " or ' inside of your string?

In JavaScript, you can escape a quote from considering it as an end of string quote by placing a backslash (\) in front of the quote.

const sampleStr = "Alan said, \"Peter is learning JavaScript\".";
This signals to JavaScript that the following quote is not the end of the string, but should instead appear inside the string. So if you were to print this to the console, you would get:

Alan said, "Peter is learning JavaScript".

----------------------------------
Quoting Strings with Single Quotes
String values in JavaScript may be written with single or double quotes, as long as you start and end with the same type of quote. Unlike some other programming languages, single and double quotes work the same in JavaScript.

const doubleQuoteStr = "This is a string"; 
const singleQuoteStr = 'This is also a string';
The reason why you might want to use one type of quote over the other is if you want to use both in a string. This might happen if you want to save a conversation in a string and have the conversation in quotes. Another use for it would be saving an <a> tag with various attributes in quotes, all within a string.

const conversation = 'Finn exclaims to Jake, "Algebraic!"';
However, this becomes a problem if you need to use the outermost quotes within it. Remember, a string has the same kind of quote at the beginning and end. But if you have that same quote somewhere in the middle, the string will stop early and throw an error.

const goodStr = 'Jake asks Finn, "Hey, let\'s go on an adventure?"'; 
const badStr = 'Finn responds, "Let's go!"';
Here badStr will throw an error.

In the goodStr above, you can use both quotes safely by using the backslash \ as an escape character.

Note: The backslash \ should not be confused with the forward slash /. They do not do the same thing.

---------------------------
Escape Sequences in Strings
Quotes are not the only characters that can be escaped inside a string. There are two reasons to use escaping characters:

To allow you to use characters you may not otherwise be able to type out, such as a carriage return.
To allow you to represent multiple quotes in a string without JavaScript misinterpreting what you mean.
We learned this in the previous challenge.

Code	Output
\'	single quote
\"	double quote
\\	backslash
\n	newline
\r	carriage return
\t	tab
\b	word boundary
\f	form feed
Note that the backslash itself must be escaped in order to display as a backslash.

----------------------------------------
Concatenating Strings with Plus Operator
In JavaScript, when the + operator is used with a String value, it is called the concatenation operator. You can build a new string out of other strings by concatenating them together.

Example

'My name is Alan,' + ' I concatenate.'
Note: Watch out for spaces. Concatenation does not add spaces between concatenated strings, so you'll need to add them yourself.

Example:

const ourStr = "I come first. " + "I come second.";
The string I come first. I come second. would be displayed in the console.

---------------------------------------------------
Concatenating Strings with the Plus Equals Operator
We can also use the += operator to concatenate a string onto the end of an existing string variable. This can be very helpful to break a long string over several lines.

Note: Watch out for spaces. Concatenation does not add spaces between concatenated strings, so you'll need to add them yourself.

Example:

let ourStr = "I come first. ";
ourStr += "I come second.";
ourStr now has a value of the string I come first. I come second..

-----------------------------------
Constructing Strings with Variables
Sometimes you will need to build a string. By using the concatenation operator (+), you can insert one or more variables into a string you're building.

Example:

const ourName = "freeCodeCamp";
const ourStr = "Hello, our name is " + ourName + ", how are you?";
ourStr would have a value of the string Hello, our name is freeCodeCamp, how are you?.

------------------------------
Appending Variables to Strings
Just as we can build a string over multiple lines out of string literals, we can also append variables to a string using the plus equals (+=) operator.

Example:

const anAdjective = "awesome!";
let ourStr = "freeCodeCamp is ";
ourStr += anAdjective;
ourStr would have the value freeCodeCamp is awesome!.

---------------------------
Find the Length of a String
You can find the length of a String value by writing .length after the string variable or string literal.

console.log("Alan Peter".length);
The value 10 would be displayed in the console. Note that the space character between "Alan" and "Peter" is also counted.

For example, if we created a variable const firstName = "Ada", we could find out how long the string Ada is by using the firstName.length property.

------------------------------------------------------------
Use Bracket Notation to Find the First Character in a String
Bracket notation is a way to get a character at a specific index within a string.

Most modern programming languages, like JavaScript, don't start counting at 1 like humans do. They start at 0. This is referred to as Zero-based indexing.

For example, the character at index 0 in the word Charles is C. So if const firstName = "Charles", you can get the value of the first letter of the string by using firstName[0].

Example:

const firstName = "Charles";
const firstLetter = firstName[0];
firstLetter would have a value of the string C.

-------------------------------
Understand String Immutability
In JavaScript, String values are immutable, which means that they cannot be altered once created.

For example, the following code:

let myStr = "Bob";
myStr[0] = "J";
cannot change the value of myStr to Job, because the contents of myStr cannot be altered. Note that this does not mean that myStr cannot be changed, just that the individual characters of a string literal cannot be changed. The only way to change myStr would be to assign it with a new string, like this:

let myStr = "Bob";
myStr = "Job";

----------------------------------------------------------
Use Bracket Notation to Find the Nth Character in a String
You can also use bracket notation to get the character at other positions within a string.

Remember that computers start counting at 0, so the first character is actually the zeroth character.

Example:

const firstName = "Ada";
const secondLetterOfFirstName = firstName[1];
secondLetterOfFirstName would have a value of the string d.

------------------------------------------------------
Understand String Immutability
In JavaScript, String values are immutable, which means that they cannot be altered once created.

For example, the following code:

let myStr = "Bob";
myStr[0] = "J";
cannot change the value of myStr to Job, because the contents of myStr cannot be altered. Note that this does not mean that myStr cannot be changed, just that the individual characters of a string literal cannot be changed. The only way to change myStr would be to assign it with a new string, like this:

let myStr = "Bob";
myStr = "Job";

------------------------------------------------------
Use Bracket Notation to Find the Nth Character in a String
You can also use bracket notation to get the character at other positions within a string.

Remember that computers start counting at 0, so the first character is actually the zeroth character.

Example:

const firstName = "Ada";
const secondLetterOfFirstName = firstName[1];
secondLetterOfFirstName would have a value of the string d.

------------------------------------------------------
Use Bracket Notation to Find the Last Character in a String
In order to get the last letter of a string, you can subtract one from the string's length.

For example, if const firstName = "Ada", you can get the value of the last letter of the string by using firstName[firstName.length - 1].

Example:

const firstName = "Ada";
const lastLetter = firstName[firstName.length - 1];
lastLetter would have a value of the string a.

------------------------------------------------------
Use Bracket Notation to Find the Nth-to-Last Character in a String
You can use the same principle we just used to retrieve the last character in a string to retrieve the Nth-to-last character.

For example, you can get the value of the third-to-last letter of the const firstName = "Augusta" string by using firstName[firstName.length - 3]

Example:

const firstName = "Augusta";
const thirdToLastLetter = firstName[firstName.length - 3];
thirdToLastLetter would have a value of the string s.

-----------
Word Blanks
You are provided sentences with some missing words, like nouns, verbs, adjectives and adverbs. You then fill in the missing pieces with words of your choice in a way that the completed sentence makes sense.

Consider this sentence - It was really ____, and we ____ ourselves ____. This sentence has three missing pieces- an adjective, a verb and an adverb, and we can add words of our choice to complete it. We can then assign the completed sentence to a variable as follows:

const sentence = "It was really " + "hot" + ", and we " + "laughed" + " ourselves " + "silly" + ".";

------------------------------------------------------
Store Multiple Values in one Variable using JavaScript Arrays
With JavaScript array variables, we can store several pieces of data in one place.

You start an array declaration with an opening square bracket, end it with a closing square bracket, and put a comma between each entry, like this:

const sandwich = ["peanut butter", "jelly", "bread"];

------------------------------------
Nest one Array within Another Array
You can also nest arrays within other arrays, like below:

const teams = [["Bulls", 23], ["White Sox", 45]];
This is also called a multi-dimensional array.

------------------------------
Access Array Data with Indexes
We can access the data inside arrays using indexes.

Array indexes are written in the same bracket notation that strings use, except that instead of specifying a character, they are specifying an entry in the array. Like strings, arrays use zero-based indexing, so the first element in an array has an index of 0.


Example

const array = [50, 60, 70];
console.log(array[0]);
const data = array[1];
The console.log(array[0]) prints 50, and data has the value 60.

------------------------------
Modify Array Data With Indexes
Unlike strings, the entries of arrays are mutable and can be changed freely, even if the array was declared with const.

Example

const ourArray = [50, 40, 30];
ourArray[0] = 15;
ourArray now has the value [15, 40, 30].

Note: There shouldn't be any spaces between the array name and the square brackets, like array [0]. Although JavaScript is able to process this correctly, this may confuse other programmers reading your code.

--------------------------------------------
Access Multi-Dimensional Arrays With Indexes
One way to think of a multi-dimensional array, is as an array of arrays. When you use brackets to access your array, the first set of brackets refers to the entries in the outer-most (the first level) array, and each additional pair of brackets refers to the next level of entries inside.

Example

const arr = [
  [1, 2, 3],
  [4, 5, 6],
  [7, 8, 9],
  [[10, 11, 12], 13, 14]
];

arr[3];
arr[3][0];
arr[3][0][1];
arr[3] is [[10, 11, 12], 13, 14], arr[3][0] is [10, 11, 12], and arr[3][0][1] is 11.

Note: There shouldn't be any spaces between the array name and the square brackets, like array [0][0] and even this array [0] [0] is not allowed. Although JavaScript is able to process this correctly, this may confuse other programmers reading your code.

-----------------------------
Manipulate Arrays With push()
An easy way to append data to the end of an array is via the push() function.

.push() takes one or more parameters and "pushes" them onto the end of the array.

Examples:

const arr1 = [1, 2, 3];
arr1.push(4);

const arr2 = ["Stimpson", "J", "cat"];
arr2.push(["happy", "joy"]);
arr1 now has the value [1, 2, 3, 4] and arr2 has the value ["Stimpson", "J", "cat", ["happy", "joy"]].

----------------------------
Manipulate Arrays With pop()
Another way to change the data in an array is with the .pop() function.

.pop() is used to pop a value off of the end of an array. We can store this popped off value by assigning it to a variable. In other words, .pop() removes the last element from an array and returns that element.

Any type of entry can be popped off of an array - numbers, strings, even nested arrays.

const threeArr = [1, 4, 6];
const oneDown = threeArr.pop();
console.log(oneDown);
console.log(threeArr);
The first console.log will display the value 6, and the second will display the value [1, 4].

------------------------------
Manipulate Arrays With shift()
pop() always removes the last element of an array. What if you want to remove the first?

That's where .shift() comes in. It works just like .pop(), except it removes the first element instead of the last.

Example:

const ourArray = ["Stimpson", "J", ["cat"]];
const removedFromOurArray = ourArray.shift();
removedFromOurArray would have a value of the string Stimpson, and ourArray would have ["J", ["cat"]].

------------------------------------------------------
Manipulate Arrays With unshift()
Not only can you shift elements off of the beginning of an array, you can also unshift elements to the beginning of an array i.e. add elements in front of the array.

.unshift() works exactly like .push(), but instead of adding the element at the end of the array, unshift() adds the element at the beginning of the array.

Example:

const ourArray = ["Stimpson", "J", "cat"];
ourArray.shift();
ourArray.unshift("Happy");
After the shift, ourArray would have the value ["J", "cat"]. After the unshift, ourArray would have the value ["Happy", "J", "cat"].

------------------------------------------------------
Shopping List
Create a shopping list in the variable myList. The list should be a multi-dimensional array containing several sub-arrays.

The first element in each sub-array should contain a string with the name of the item. The second element should be a number representing the quantity i.e.

["Chocolate Bar", 15]
There should be at least 5 sub-arrays in the list.

------------------------------------------------------
Write Reusable JavaScript with Functions
In JavaScript, we can divide up our code into reusable parts called functions.

Here's an example of a function:

function functionName() {
  console.log("Hello World");
}
You can call or invoke this function by using its name followed by parentheses, like this: functionName(); Each time the function is called it will print out the message Hello World on the dev console. All of the code between the curly braces will be executed every time the function is called.

------------------------------------------------------
Passing Values to Functions with Arguments
Parameters are variables that act as placeholders for the values that are to be input to a function when it is called. When a function is defined, it is typically defined along with one or more parameters. The actual values that are input (or "passed") into a function when it is called are known as arguments.

Here is a function with two parameters, param1 and param2:

function testFun(param1, param2) {
  console.log(param1, param2);
}
Then we can call testFun like this: testFun("Hello", "World");. We have passed two string arguments, Hello and World. Inside the function, param1 will equal the string Hello and param2 will equal the string World. Note that you could call testFun again with different arguments and the parameters would take on the value of the new arguments.

------------------------------------------------------
Return a Value from a Function with Return
We can pass values into a function with arguments. You can use a return statement to send a value back out of a function.

Example

function plusThree(num) {
  return num + 3;
}

const answer = plusThree(5);
answer has the value 8.

plusThree takes an argument for num and returns a value equal to num + 3.

------------------------------------------------------
Global Scope and Functions
In JavaScript, scope refers to the visibility of variables. Variables which are defined outside of a function block have Global scope. This means, they can be seen everywhere in your JavaScript code.

Variables which are declared without the let or const keywords are automatically created in the global scope. This can create unintended consequences elsewhere in your code or when running a function again. You should always declare your variables with let or const.

------------------------------------------------------
Local Scope and Functions
Variables which are declared within a function, as well as the function parameters, have local scope. That means they are only visible within that function.

Here is a function myTest with a local variable called loc.

function myTest() {
  const loc = "foo";
  console.log(loc);
}

myTest();
console.log(loc);
The myTest() function call will display the string foo in the console. The console.log(loc) line (outside of the myTest function) will throw an error, as loc is not defined outside of the function.

------------------------------------------------------
Global vs. Local Scope in Functions
It is possible to have both local and global variables with the same name. When you do this, the local variable takes precedence over the global variable.

In this example:

const someVar = "Hat";

function myFun() {
  const someVar = "Head";
  return someVar;
}
The function myFun will return the string Head because the local version of the variable is present.

------------------------------------------------------
Understanding Undefined Value returned from a Function
A function can include the return statement but it does not have to. In the case that the function doesn't have a return statement, when you call it, the function processes the inner code but the returned value is undefined.

Example

let sum = 0;

function addSum(num) {
  sum = sum + num;
}

addSum(3);
addSum is a function without a return statement. The function will change the global sum variable but the returned value of the function is undefined.

------------------------------------------------------
Assignment with a Returned Value
If you'll recall from our discussion about Storing Values with the Assignment Operator, everything to the right of the equal sign is resolved before the value is assigned. This means we can take the return value of a function and assign it to a variable.

Assume we have pre-defined a function sum which adds two numbers together, then:

ourSum = sum(5, 12);
will call the sum function, which returns a value of 17 and assigns it to the ourSum variable.

------------------------------------------------------
Stand in Line
In Computer Science a queue is an abstract Data Structure where items are kept in order. New items can be added at the back of the queue and old items are taken off from the front of the queue.

------------------------------------------------------
Understanding Boolean Values
Another data type is the Boolean. Booleans may only be one of two values: true or false. They are basically little on-off switches, where true is on and false is off. These two states are mutually exclusive.

Note: Boolean values are never written with quotes. The strings "true" and "false" are not Boolean and have no special meaning in JavaScript.

------------------------------------------------------
Use Conditional Logic with If Statements
if statements are used to make decisions in code. The keyword if tells JavaScript to execute the code in the curly braces under certain conditions, defined in the parentheses. These conditions are known as Boolean conditions and they may only be true or false.

When the condition evaluates to true, the program executes the statement inside the curly braces. When the Boolean condition evaluates to false, the statement inside the curly braces will not execute.

Pseudocode

if (condition is true) {
  statement is executed
}
Example

function test (myCondition) {
  if (myCondition) {
    return "It was true";
  }
  return "It was false";
}

test(true);
test(false);
test(true) returns the string It was true, and test(false) returns the string It was false.

When test is called with a value of true, the if statement evaluates myCondition to see if it is true or not. Since it is true, the function returns It was true. When we call test with a value of false, myCondition is not true and the statement in the curly braces is not executed and the function returns It was false.

------------------------------------------------------
Comparison with the Equality Operator
There are many comparison operators in JavaScript. All of these operators return a boolean true or false value.

The most basic operator is the equality operator ==. The equality operator compares two values and returns true if they're equivalent or false if they are not. Note that equality is different from assignment (=), which assigns the value on the right of the operator to a variable on the left.

function equalityTest(myVal) {
  if (myVal == 10) {
    return "Equal";
  }
  return "Not Equal";
}
If myVal is equal to 10, the equality operator returns true, so the code in the curly braces will execute, and the function will return Equal. Otherwise, the function will return Not Equal. In order for JavaScript to compare two different data types (for example, numbers and strings), it must convert one type to another. This is known as Type Coercion. Once it does, however, it can compare terms as follows:

1   ==  1  // true
1   ==  2  // false
1   == '1' // true
"3" ==  3  // true

------------------------------------------------------
Comparison with the Strict Equality Operator
Strict equality (===) is the counterpart to the equality operator (==). However, unlike the equality operator, which attempts to convert both values being compared to a common type, the strict equality operator does not perform a type conversion.

If the values being compared have different types, they are considered unequal, and the strict equality operator will return false.

Examples

3 ===  3  // true
3 === '3' // false
In the second example, 3 is a Number type and '3' is a String type.

------------------------------------------------------
Practice comparing different values
In the last two challenges, we learned about the equality operator (==) and the strict equality operator (===). Let's do a quick review and practice using these operators some more.

If the values being compared are not of the same type, the equality operator will perform a type conversion, and then evaluate the values. However, the strict equality operator will compare both the data type and value as-is, without converting one type to the other.

Examples

3 == '3' returns true because JavaScript performs type conversion from string to number. 3 === '3' returns false because the types are different and type conversion is not performed.

Note: In JavaScript, you can determine the type of a variable or a value with the typeof operator, as follows:

typeof 3
typeof '3'
typeof 3 returns the string number, and typeof '3' returns the string string.

------------------------------------------------------
Comparison with the Inequality Operator
The inequality operator (!=) is the opposite of the equality operator. It means not equal and returns false where equality would return true and vice versa. Like the equality operator, the inequality operator will convert data types of values while comparing.

Examples

1 !=  2    // true
1 != "1"   // false
1 != '1'   // false
1 != true  // false
0 != false // false

------------------------------------------------------
Comparison with the Strict Inequality Operator
The strict inequality operator (!==) is the logical opposite of the strict equality operator. It means "Strictly Not Equal" and returns false where strict equality would return true and vice versa. The strict inequality operator will not convert data types.

Examples

3 !==  3  // false
3 !== '3' // true
4 !==  3  // true

------------------------------------------------------
Comparison with the Greater Than Operator
The greater than operator (>) compares the values of two numbers. If the number to the left is greater than the number to the right, it returns true. Otherwise, it returns false.

Like the equality operator, the greater than operator will convert data types of values while comparing.

Examples

5   >  3  // true
7   > '3' // true
2   >  3  // false
'1' >  9  // false

------------------------------------------------------
Comparison with the Greater Than Or Equal To Operator
The greater than or equal to operator (>=) compares the values of two numbers. If the number to the left is greater than or equal to the number to the right, it returns true. Otherwise, it returns false.

Like the equality operator, the greater than or equal to operator will convert data types while comparing.

Examples

6   >=  6  // true
7   >= '3' // true
2   >=  3  // false
'7' >=  9  // false

------------------------------------------------------
Comparison with the Less Than Operator
The less than operator (<) compares the values of two numbers. If the number to the left is less than the number to the right, it returns true. Otherwise, it returns false. Like the equality operator, the less than operator converts data types while comparing.

Examples

2   < 5 // true
'3' < 7 // true
5   < 5 // false
3   < 2 // false
'8' < 4 // false

------------------------------------------------------
Comparison with the Less Than Or Equal To Operator
The less than or equal to operator (<=) compares the values of two numbers. If the number to the left is less than or equal to the number to the right, it returns true. If the number on the left is greater than the number on the right, it returns false. Like the equality operator, the less than or equal to operator converts data types.

Examples

4   <= 5 // true
'7' <= 7 // true
5   <= 5 // true
3   <= 2 // false
'8' <= 4 // false

------------------------------------------------------
Comparisons with the Logical And Operator
Sometimes you will need to test more than one thing at a time. The logical and operator (&&) returns true if and only if the operands to the left and right of it are true.

The same effect could be achieved by nesting an if statement inside another if:

if (num > 5) {
  if (num < 10) {
    return "Yes";
  }
}
return "No";
will only return Yes if num is greater than 5 and less than 10. The same logic can be written as:

if (num > 5 && num < 10) {
  return "Yes";
}
return "No";

------------------------------------------------------
Comparisons with the Logical Or Operator
The logical or operator (||) returns true if either of the operands is true. Otherwise, it returns false.

The logical or operator is composed of two pipe symbols: (||). This can typically be found between your Backspace and Enter keys.

The pattern below should look familiar from prior waypoints:

if (num > 10) {
  return "No";
}
if (num < 5) {
  return "No";
}
return "Yes";
will return Yes only if num is between 5 and 10 (5 and 10 included). The same logic can be written as:

if (num > 10 || num < 5) {
  return "No";
}
return "Yes";


------------------------------------------------------
Introducing Else Statements
When a condition for an if statement is true, the block of code following it is executed. What about when that condition is false? Normally nothing would happen. With an else statement, an alternate block of code can be executed.

if (num > 10) {
  return "Bigger than 10";
} else {
  return "10 or Less";
}

------------------------------------------------------
Introducing Else If Statements
If you have multiple conditions that need to be addressed, you can chain if statements together with else if statements.

if (num > 15) {
  return "Bigger than 15";
} else if (num < 5) {
  return "Smaller than 5";
} else {
  return "Between 5 and 15";
}

------------------------------------------------------
Logical Order in If Else Statements
Order is important in if, else if statements.

The function is executed from top to bottom so you will want to be careful of what statement comes first.

Take these two functions as an example.

Here's the first:

function foo(x) {
  if (x < 1) {
    return "Less than one";
  } else if (x < 2) {
    return "Less than two";
  } else {
    return "Greater than or equal to two";
  }
}
And the second just switches the order of the statements:

function bar(x) {
  if (x < 2) {
    return "Less than two";
  } else if (x < 1) {
    return "Less than one";
  } else {
    return "Greater than or equal to two";
  }
}
While these two functions look nearly identical if we pass a number to both we get different outputs.

foo(0)
bar(0)
foo(0) will return the string Less than one, and bar(0) will return the string Less than two.

------------------------------------------------------
Chaining If Else Statements
if/else statements can be chained together for complex logic. Here is pseudocode of multiple chained if / else if statements:

if (condition1) {
  statement1
} else if (condition2) {
  statement2
} else if (condition3) {
  statement3
. . .
} else {
  statementN
}

------------------------------------------------------
Golf Code
In the game of Golf, each hole has a par, meaning, the average number of strokes a golfer is expected to make in order to sink the ball in the hole to complete the play. Depending on how far above or below par your strokes are, there is a different nickname.

Your function will be passed par and strokes arguments. Return the correct string according to this table which lists the strokes in order of priority; top (highest) to bottom (lowest):

Strokes	Return
1	"Hole-in-one!"
<= par - 2	"Eagle"
par - 1	"Birdie"
par	"Par"
par + 1	"Bogey"
par + 2	"Double Bogey"
>= par + 3	"Go Home!"
par and strokes will always be numeric and positive. We have added an array of all the names for your convenience.

------------------------------------------------------
Selecting from Many Options with Switch Statements
If you have many options to choose from, use a switch statement. A switch statement tests a value and can have many case statements which define various possible values. Statements are executed from the first matched case value until a break is encountered.

Here is an example of a switch statement:

switch (lowercaseLetter) {
  case "a":
    console.log("A");
    break;
  case "b":
    console.log("B");
    break;
}
case values are tested with strict equality (===). The break tells JavaScript to stop executing statements. If the break is omitted, the next statement will be executed.

------------------------------------------------------
Adding a Default Option in Switch Statements
In a switch statement you may not be able to specify all possible values as case statements. Instead, you can add the default statement which will be executed if no matching case statements are found. Think of it like the final else statement in an if/else chain.

A default statement should be the last case.

switch (num) {
  case value1:
    statement1;
    break;
  case value2:
    statement2;
    break;
...
  default:
    defaultStatement;
    break;
}

------------------------------------------------------
Multiple Identical Options in Switch Statements
If the break statement is omitted from a switch statement's case, the following case statement(s) are executed until a break is encountered. If you have multiple inputs with the same output, you can represent them in a switch statement like this:

let result = "";
switch (val) {
  case 1:
  case 2:
  case 3:
    result = "1, 2, or 3";
    break;
  case 4:
    result = "4 alone";
}
Cases for 1, 2, and 3 will all produce the same result.

------------------------------------------------------
Replacing If Else Chains with Switch
If you have many options to choose from, a switch statement can be easier to write than many chained if/else if statements. The following:

if (val === 1) {
  answer = "a";
} else if (val === 2) {
  answer = "b";
} else {
  answer = "c";
}
can be replaced with:

switch (val) {
  case 1:
    answer = "a";
    break;
  case 2:
    answer = "b";
    break;
  default:
    answer = "c";
}

------------------------------------------------------
Returning Boolean Values from Functions
You may recall from Comparison with the Equality Operator that all comparison operators return a boolean true or false value.

Sometimes people use an if/else statement to do a comparison, like this:

function isEqual(a, b) {
  if (a === b) {
    return true;
  } else {
    return false;
  }
}
But there's a better way to do this. Since === returns true or false, we can return the result of the comparison:

function isEqual(a, b) {
  return a === b;
}

------------------------------------------------------
Return Early Pattern for Functions
When a return statement is reached, the execution of the current function stops and control returns to the calling location.

Example

function myFun() {
  console.log("Hello");
  return "World";
  console.log("byebye")
}
myFun();
The above will display the string Hello in the console, and return the string World. The string byebye will never display in the console, because the function exits at the return statement.

------------------------------------------------------
Counting Cards
In the casino game Blackjack, a player can determine whether they have an advantage on the next hand over the house by keeping track of the relative number of high and low cards remaining in the deck. This is called Card Counting.

Having more high cards remaining in the deck favors the player. Each card is assigned a value according to the table below. When the count is positive, the player should bet high. When the count is zero or negative, the player should bet low.

Count Change	Cards
+1	2, 3, 4, 5, 6
0	7, 8, 9
-1	10, 'J', 'Q', 'K', 'A'
You will write a card counting function. It will receive a card parameter, which can be a number or a string, and increment or decrement the global count variable according to the card's value (see table). The function will then return a string with the current count and the string Bet if the count is positive, or Hold if the count is zero or negative. The current count and the player's decision (Bet or Hold) should be separated by a single space.

Example Outputs: -3 Hold or 5 Bet

Hint
Do NOT reset count to 0 when value is 7, 8, or 9.
Do NOT return an array.
Do NOT include quotes (single or double) in the output.

------------------------------------------------------
Build JavaScript Objects
You may have heard the term object before.

Objects are similar to arrays, except that instead of using indexes to access and modify their data, you access the data in objects through what are called properties.

Objects are useful for storing data in a structured way, and can represent real world objects, like a cat.

Here's a sample cat object:

const cat = {
  "name": "Whiskers",
  "legs": 4,
  "tails": 1,
  "enemies": ["Water", "Dogs"]
};
In this example, all the properties are stored as strings, such as name, legs, and tails. However, you can also use numbers as properties. You can even omit the quotes for single-word string properties, as follows:

const anotherObject = {
  make: "Ford",
  5: "five",
  "model": "focus"
};
However, if your object has any non-string properties, JavaScript will automatically typecast them as strings.

------------------------------------------------------
Accessing Object Properties with Dot Notation
There are two ways to access the properties of an object: dot notation (.) and bracket notation ([]), similar to an array.

Dot notation is what you use when you know the name of the property you're trying to access ahead of time.

Here is a sample of using dot notation (.) to read an object's property:

const myObj = {
  prop1: "val1",
  prop2: "val2"
};

const prop1val = myObj.prop1;
const prop2val = myObj.prop2;
prop1val would have a value of the string val1, and prop2val would have a value of the string val2.

------------------------------------------------------
Accessing Object Properties with Bracket Notation
The second way to access the properties of an object is bracket notation ([]). If the property of the object you are trying to access has a space in its name, you will need to use bracket notation.

However, you can still use bracket notation on object properties without spaces.

Here is a sample of using bracket notation to read an object's property:

const myObj = {
  "Space Name": "Kirk",
  "More Space": "Spock",
  "NoSpace": "USS Enterprise"
};

myObj["Space Name"];
myObj['More Space'];
myObj["NoSpace"];
myObj["Space Name"] would be the string Kirk, myObj['More Space'] would be the string Spock, and myObj["NoSpace"] would be the string USS Enterprise.

Note that property names with spaces in them must be in quotes (single or double).

------------------------------------------------------
Accessing Object Properties with Variables
Another use of bracket notation on objects is to access a property which is stored as the value of a variable. This can be very useful for iterating through an object's properties or when accessing a lookup table.

Here is an example of using a variable to access a property:

const dogs = {
  Fido: "Mutt",
  Hunter: "Doberman",
  Snoopie: "Beagle"
};

const myDog = "Hunter";
const myBreed = dogs[myDog];
console.log(myBreed);
The string Doberman would be displayed in the console.

Another way you can use this concept is when the property's name is collected dynamically during the program execution, as follows:

const someObj = {
  propName: "John"
};

function propPrefix(str) {
  const s = "prop";
  return s + str;
}

const someProp = propPrefix("Name");
console.log(someObj[someProp]);
someProp would have a value of the string propName, and the string John would be displayed in the console.

Note that we do not use quotes around the variable name when using it to access the property because we are using the value of the variable, not the name.

------------------------------------------------------
Updating Object Properties
After you've created a JavaScript object, you can update its properties at any time just like you would update any other variable. You can use either dot or bracket notation to update.

For example, let's look at ourDog:

const ourDog = {
  "name": "Camper",
  "legs": 4,
  "tails": 1,
  "friends": ["everything!"]
};
Since he's a particularly happy dog, let's change his name to the string Happy Camper. Here's how we update his object's name property: ourDog.name = "Happy Camper"; or ourDog["name"] = "Happy Camper"; Now when we evaluate ourDog.name, instead of getting Camper, we'll get his new name, Happy Camper.

------------------------------------------------------
Add New Properties to a JavaScript Object
You can add new properties to existing JavaScript objects the same way you would modify them.

Here's how we would add a bark property to ourDog:

ourDog.bark = "bow-wow";
or

ourDog["bark"] = "bow-wow";
Now when we evaluate ourDog.bark, we'll get his bark, bow-wow.

Example:

const ourDog = {
  "name": "Camper",
  "legs": 4,
  "tails": 1,
  "friends": ["everything!"]
};

ourDog.bark = "bow-wow";

------------------------------------------------------
Delete Properties from a JavaScript Object
We can also delete properties from objects like this:

delete ourDog.bark;
Example:

const ourDog = {
  "name": "Camper",
  "legs": 4,
  "tails": 1,
  "friends": ["everything!"],
  "bark": "bow-wow"
};

delete ourDog.bark;
After the last line shown above, ourDog looks like:

{
  "name": "Camper",
  "legs": 4,
  "tails": 1,
  "friends": ["everything!"]
}

------------------------------------------------------
Testing Objects for Properties
Sometimes it is useful to check if the property of a given object exists or not. We can use the .hasOwnProperty(propname) method of objects to determine if that object has the given property name. .hasOwnProperty() returns true or false if the property is found or not.

Example

const myObj = {
  top: "hat",
  bottom: "pants"
};

myObj.hasOwnProperty("top");
myObj.hasOwnProperty("middle");
The first hasOwnProperty returns true, while the second returns false.

------------------------------------------------------
Manipulating Complex Objects
Sometimes you may want to store data in a flexible Data Structure. A JavaScript object is one way to handle flexible data. They allow for arbitrary combinations of strings, numbers, booleans, arrays, functions, and objects.

Here's an example of a complex data structure:

const ourMusic = [
  {
    "artist": "Daft Punk",
    "title": "Homework",
    "release_year": 1997,
    "formats": [ 
      "CD", 
      "Cassette", 
      "LP"
    ],
    "gold": true
  }
];
This is an array which contains one object inside. The object has various pieces of metadata about an album. It also has a nested formats array. If you want to add more album records, you can do this by adding records to the top level array. Objects hold data in a property, which has a key-value format. In the example above, "artist": "Daft Punk" is a property that has a key of artist and a value of Daft Punk.

Note: You will need to place a comma after every object in the array, unless it is the last object in the array.

------------------------------------------------------
Accessing Nested Objects
The sub-properties of objects can be accessed by chaining together the dot or bracket notation.

Here is a nested object:

const ourStorage = {
  "desk": {
    "drawer": "stapler"
  },
  "cabinet": {
    "top drawer": { 
      "folder1": "a file",
      "folder2": "secrets"
    },
    "bottom drawer": "soda"
  }
};

ourStorage.cabinet["top drawer"].folder2;
ourStorage.desk.drawer;
ourStorage.cabinet["top drawer"].folder2 would be the string secrets, and ourStorage.desk.drawer would be the string stapler.

------------------------------------------------------
Accessing Nested Arrays
As we have seen in earlier examples, objects can contain both nested objects and nested arrays. Similar to accessing nested objects, array bracket notation can be chained to access nested arrays.

Here is an example of how to access a nested array:

const ourPets = [
  {
    animalType: "cat",
    names: [
      "Meowzer",
      "Fluffy",
      "Kit-Cat"
    ]
  },
  {
    animalType: "dog",
    names: [
      "Spot",
      "Bowser",
      "Frankie"
    ]
  }
];

ourPets[0].names[1];
ourPets[1].names[0];
ourPets[0].names[1] would be the string Fluffy, and ourPets[1].names[0] would be the string Spot.

------------------------------------------------------
Record Collection
You are given an object literal representing a part of your musical album collection. Each album has a unique id number as its key and several other properties. Not all albums have complete information.

You start with an updateRecords function that takes an object literal, records, containing the musical album collection, an id, a prop (like artist or tracks), and a value. Complete the function using the rules below to modify the object passed to the function.

Your function must always return the entire record collection object.
If prop isn't tracks and value isn't an empty string, update or set that album's prop to value.
If prop is tracks but the album doesn't have a tracks property, create an empty array and add value to it.
If prop is tracks and value isn't an empty string, add value to the end of the album's existing tracks array.
If value is an empty string, delete the given prop property from the album.
Note: A copy of the recordCollection object is used for the tests.

------------------------------------------------------
Iterate with JavaScript While Loops
You can run the same code multiple times by using a loop.

The first type of loop we will learn is called a while loop because it runs while a specified condition is true and stops once that condition is no longer true.

const ourArray = [];
let i = 0;

while (i < 5) {
  ourArray.push(i);
  i++;
}
In the code example above, the while loop will execute 5 times and append the numbers 0 through 4 to ourArray.

Let's try getting a while loop to work by pushing values to an array.

------------------------------------------------------
Iterate with JavaScript For Loops
You can run the same code multiple times by using a loop.

The most common type of JavaScript loop is called a for loop because it runs for a specific number of times.

For loops are declared with three optional expressions separated by semicolons:

for (a; b; c), where a is the initialization statement, b is the condition statement, and c is the final expression.

The initialization statement is executed one time only before the loop starts. It is typically used to define and setup your loop variable.

The condition statement is evaluated at the beginning of every loop iteration and will continue as long as it evaluates to true. When the condition is false at the start of the iteration, the loop will stop executing. This means if the condition starts as false, your loop will never execute.

The final expression is executed at the end of each loop iteration, prior to the next condition check and is usually used to increment or decrement your loop counter.

In the following example we initialize with i = 0 and iterate while our condition i < 5 is true. We'll increment i by 1 in each loop iteration with i++ as our final expression.

const ourArray = [];

for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
  ourArray.push(i);
}
ourArray will now have the value [0, 1, 2, 3, 4].

------------------------------------------------------
Iterate Odd Numbers With a For Loop
For loops don't have to iterate one at a time. By changing our final-expression, we can count by even numbers.

We'll start at i = 0 and loop while i < 10. We'll increment i by 2 each loop with i += 2.

const ourArray = [];

for (let i = 0; i < 10; i += 2) {
  ourArray.push(i);
}
ourArray will now contain [0, 2, 4, 6, 8]. Let's change our initialization so we can count by odd numbers.

------------------------------------------------------
Count Backwards With a For Loop
A for loop can also count backwards, so long as we can define the right conditions.

In order to decrement by two each iteration, we'll need to change our initialization, condition, and final expression.

We'll start at i = 10 and loop while i > 0. We'll decrement i by 2 each loop with i -= 2.

const ourArray = [];

for (let i = 10; i > 0; i -= 2) {
  ourArray.push(i);
}
ourArray will now contain [10, 8, 6, 4, 2]. Let's change our initialization and final expression so we can count backwards by twos to create an array of descending odd numbers.

------------------------------------------------------
Iterate Through an Array with a For Loop
A common task in JavaScript is to iterate through the contents of an array. One way to do that is with a for loop. This code will output each element of the array arr to the console:

const arr = [10, 9, 8, 7, 6];

for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
   console.log(arr[i]);
}
Remember that arrays have zero-based indexing, which means the last index of the array is length - 1. Our condition for this loop is i < arr.length, which stops the loop when i is equal to length. In this case the last iteration is i === 4 i.e. when i becomes equal to arr.length - 1 and outputs 6 to the console. Then i increases to 5, and the loop terminates because i < arr.length is false.

------------------------------------------------------
Nesting For Loops
If you have a multi-dimensional array, you can use the same logic as the prior waypoint to loop through both the array and any sub-arrays. Here is an example:

const arr = [
  [1, 2], [3, 4], [5, 6]
];

for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
  for (let j = 0; j < arr[i].length; j++) {
    console.log(arr[i][j]);
  }
}
This outputs each sub-element in arr one at a time. Note that for the inner loop, we are checking the .length of arr[i], since arr[i] is itself an array.

------------------------------------------------------
Generate Random Fractions with JavaScript
Random numbers are useful for creating random behavior.

JavaScript has a Math.random() function that generates a random decimal number between 0 (inclusive) and 1 (exclusive). Thus Math.random() can return a 0 but never return a 1.

Note: Like Storing Values with the Assignment Operator, all function calls will be resolved before the return executes, so we can return the value of the Math.random() function.

------------------------------------------------------
Generate Random Whole Numbers with JavaScript
It's great that we can generate random decimal numbers, but it's even more useful if we use it to generate random whole numbers.

Use Math.random() to generate a random decimal.
Multiply that random decimal by 20.
Use another function, Math.floor() to round the number down to its nearest whole number.
Remember that Math.random() can never quite return a 1 and, because we're rounding down, it's impossible to actually get 20. This technique will give us a whole number between 0 and 19.

Putting everything together, this is what our code looks like:

Math.floor(Math.random() * 20);
We are calling Math.random(), multiplying the result by 20, then passing the value to Math.floor() function to round the value down to the nearest whole number.

------------------------------------------------------
Iterate with JavaScript Do...While Loops
The next type of loop you will learn is called a do...while loop. It is called a do...while loop because it will first do one pass of the code inside the loop no matter what, and then continue to run the loop while the specified condition evaluates to true.

const ourArray = [];
let i = 0;

do {
  ourArray.push(i);
  i++;
} while (i < 5);
The example above behaves similar to other types of loops, and the resulting array will look like [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]. However, what makes the do...while different from other loops is how it behaves when the condition fails on the first check. Let's see this in action. Here is a regular while loop that will run the code in the loop as long as i < 5:

const ourArray = []; 
let i = 5;

while (i < 5) {
  ourArray.push(i);
  i++;
}
In this example, we initialize the value of ourArray to an empty array and the value of i to 5. When we execute the while loop, the condition evaluates to false because i is not less than 5, so we do not execute the code inside the loop. The result is that ourArray will end up with no values added to it, and it will still look like [] when all of the code in the example above has completed running. Now, take a look at a do...while loop:

const ourArray = []; 
let i = 5;

do {
  ourArray.push(i);
  i++;
} while (i < 5);
In this case, we initialize the value of i to 5, just like we did with the while loop. When we get to the next line, there is no condition to evaluate, so we go to the code inside the curly braces and execute it. We will add a single element to the array and then increment i before we get to the condition check. When we finally evaluate the condition i < 5 on the last line, we see that i is now 6, which fails the conditional check, so we exit the loop and are done. At the end of the above example, the value of ourArray is [5]. Essentially, a do...while loop ensures that the code inside the loop will run at least once. Let's try getting a do...while loop to work by pushing values to an array.

Replace Loops using Recursion
Recursion is the concept that a function can be expressed in terms of itself. To help understand this, start by thinking about the following task: multiply the first n elements of an array to create the product of those elements. Using a for loop, you could do this:

  function multiply(arr, n) {
    let product = 1;
    for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
      product *= arr[i];
    }
    return product;
  }
However, notice that multiply(arr, n) == multiply(arr, n - 1) * arr[n - 1]. That means you can rewrite multiply in terms of itself and never need to use a loop.

  function multiply(arr, n) {
    if (n <= 0) {
      return 1;
    } else {
      return multiply(arr, n - 1) * arr[n - 1];
    }
  }
The recursive version of multiply breaks down like this. In the base case, where n <= 0, it returns 1. For larger values of n, it calls itself, but with n - 1. That function call is evaluated in the same way, calling multiply again until n <= 0. At this point, all the functions can return and the original multiply returns the answer.

Note: Recursive functions must have a base case when they return without calling the function again (in this example, when n <= 0), otherwise they can never finish executing.

Profile Lookup
We have an array of objects representing different people in our contacts lists.

A lookUpProfile function that takes name and a property (prop) as arguments has been pre-written for you.

The function should check if name is an actual contact's firstName and the given property (prop) is a property of that contact.

If both are true, then return the "value" of that property.

If name does not correspond to any contacts then return the string No such contact.

If prop does not correspond to any valid properties of a contact found to match name then return the string No such property.

Generate Random Fractions with JavaScript
Random numbers are useful for creating random behavior.

JavaScript has a Math.random() function that generates a random decimal number between 0 (inclusive) and 1 (exclusive). Thus Math.random() can return a 0 but never return a 1.

Note: Like Storing Values with the Assignment Operator, all function calls will be resolved before the return executes, so we can return the value of the Math.random() function.

------------------------------------------------------
Generate Random Whole Numbers with JavaScript
It's great that we can generate random decimal numbers, but it's even more useful if we use it to generate random whole numbers.

Use Math.random() to generate a random decimal.
Multiply that random decimal by 20.
Use another function, Math.floor() to round the number down to its nearest whole number.
Remember that Math.random() can never quite return a 1 and, because we're rounding down, it's impossible to actually get 20. This technique will give us a whole number between 0 and 19.

Putting everything together, this is what our code looks like:

Math.floor(Math.random() * 20);
We are calling Math.random(), multiplying the result by 20, then passing the value to Math.floor() function to round the value down to the nearest whole number.

------------------------------------------------------
Generate Random Whole Numbers within a Range
Instead of generating a random whole number between zero and a given number like we did before, we can generate a random whole number that falls within a range of two specific numbers.

To do this, we'll define a minimum number min and a maximum number max.

Here's the formula we'll use. Take a moment to read it and try to understand what this code is doing:

Math.floor(Math.random() * (max - min + 1)) + min

------------------------------------------------------
Use the parseInt Function
The parseInt() function parses a string and returns an integer. Here's an example:

const a = parseInt("007");
The above function converts the string 007 to the integer 7. If the first character in the string can't be converted into a number, then it returns NaN.

------------------------------------------------------
Use the parseInt Function with a Radix
The parseInt() function parses a string and returns an integer. It takes a second argument for the radix, which specifies the base of the number in the string. The radix can be an integer between 2 and 36.

The function call looks like:

parseInt(string, radix);
And here's an example:

const a = parseInt("11", 2);
The radix variable says that 11 is in the binary system, or base 2. This example converts the string 11 to an integer 3.

------------------------------------------------------
Use the Conditional (Ternary) Operator
The conditional operator, also called the ternary operator, can be used as a one line if-else expression.

The syntax is a ? b : c, where a is the condition, b is the code to run when the condition returns true, and c is the code to run when the condition returns false.

The following function uses an if/else statement to check a condition:

function findGreater(a, b) {
  if(a > b) {
    return "a is greater";
  }
  else {
    return "b is greater or equal";
  }
}
This can be re-written using the conditional operator:

function findGreater(a, b) {
  return a > b ? "a is greater" : "b is greater or equal";
}

------------------------------------------------------
Use Multiple Conditional (Ternary) Operators
In the previous challenge, you used a single conditional operator. You can also chain them together to check for multiple conditions.

The following function uses if, else if, and else statements to check multiple conditions:

function findGreaterOrEqual(a, b) {
  if (a === b) {
    return "a and b are equal";
  }
  else if (a > b) {
    return "a is greater";
  }
  else {
    return "b is greater";
  }
}
The above function can be re-written using multiple conditional operators:

function findGreaterOrEqual(a, b) {
  return (a === b) ? "a and b are equal" 
    : (a > b) ? "a is greater" 
    : "b is greater";
}
It is considered best practice to format multiple conditional operators such that each condition is on a separate line, as shown above. Using multiple conditional operators without proper indentation may make your code hard to read. For example:

function findGreaterOrEqual(a, b) {
  return (a === b) ? "a and b are equal" : (a > b) ? "a is greater" : "b is greater";
}

------------------------------------------------------
Use Recursion to Create a Countdown
In a previous challenge, you learned how to use recursion to replace a for loop. Now, let's look at a more complex function that returns an array of consecutive integers starting with 1 through the number passed to the function.

As mentioned in the previous challenge, there will be a base case. The base case tells the recursive function when it no longer needs to call itself. It is a simple case where the return value is already known. There will also be a recursive call which executes the original function with different arguments. If the function is written correctly, eventually the base case will be reached.

For example, say you want to write a recursive function that returns an array containing the numbers 1 through n. This function will need to accept an argument, n, representing the final number. Then it will need to call itself with progressively smaller values of n until it reaches 1. You could write the function as follows:

function countup(n) {
  if (n < 1) {
    return [];
  } else {
    const countArray = countup(n - 1);
    countArray.push(n);
    return countArray;
  }
}
console.log(countup(5));
The value [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] will be displayed in the console.

At first, this seems counterintuitive since the value of n decreases, but the values in the final array are increasing. This happens because the push happens last, after the recursive call has returned. At the point where n is pushed into the array, countup(n - 1) has already been evaluated and returned [1, 2, ..., n - 1].

------------------------------------------------------
Use Recursion to Create a Range of Numbers
Continuing from the previous challenge, we provide you another opportunity to create a recursive function to solve a problem.

We have defined a function named rangeOfNumbers with two parameters. The function should return an array of integers which begins with a number represented by the startNum parameter and ends with a number represented by the endNum parameter. The starting number will always be less than or equal to the ending number. Your function must use recursion by calling itself and not use loops of any kind. It should also work for cases where both startNum and endNum are the same.

function rangeOfNumbers(startNum, endNum) {
    return [];
  };
