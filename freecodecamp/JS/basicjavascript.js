JavaScript is a scripting language you can use to make web pages interactive. It is one of the core technologies of the web, along with HTML and CSS, and is supported by all modern browsers.

In this course, you'll learn fundamental programming concepts in JavaScript. You'll start with basic data structures like numbers and strings. Then you'll learn to work with arrays, objects, functions, loops, if/else statements, and more.

----------------------------
Comment Your JavaScript Code
Comments are lines of code that JavaScript will intentionally ignore. Comments are a great way to leave notes to yourself and to other people who will later need to figure out what that code does.

There are two ways to write comments in JavaScript:

Using // will tell JavaScript to ignore the remainder of the text on the current line. This is an in-line comment:

// This is an in-line comment.
You can make a multi-line comment beginning with /* and ending with */. This is a multi-line comment:

/* This is a
multi-line comment */
NOTE: As you write code, you should regularly add comments to clarify the function of parts of your code. Good commenting can help communicate the intent of your code—both for others and for your future self.

----------------------------
Declare JavaScript Variables
In computer science, data is anything that is meaningful to the computer. JavaScript provides eight different data types which are undefined, null, boolean, string, symbol, bigint, number, and object.

For example, computers distinguish between numbers, such as the number 12, and strings, such as "12", "dog", or "123 cats", which are collections of characters. Computers can perform mathematical operations on a number, but not on a string.

Variables allow computers to store and manipulate data in a dynamic fashion. They do this by using a "label" to point to the data rather than using the data itself. Any of the eight data types may be stored in a variable.

Variables are similar to the x and y variables you use in mathematics, which means they're a simple name to represent the data we want to refer to. Computer variables differ from mathematical variables in that they can store different values at different times.

We tell JavaScript to create or declare a variable by putting the keyword var in front of it, like so:

var ourName;
creates a variable called ourName. In JavaScript we end statements with semicolons. Variable names can be made up of numbers, letters, and $ or _, but may not contain spaces or start with a number.

----------------------------
Storing Values with the Assignment Operator
In JavaScript, you can store a value in a variable with the assignment operator (=).

myVariable = 5;
This assigns the Number value 5 to myVariable.

If there are any calculations to the right of the = operator, those are performed before the value is assigned to the variable on the left of the operator.

var myVar;
myVar = 5;
First, this code creates a variable named myVar. Then, the code assigns 5 to myVar. Now, if myVar appears again in the code, the program will treat it as if it is 5.

----------------------------------------------
Assigning the Value of One Variable to Another
After a value is assigned to a variable using the assignment operator, you can assign the value of that variable to another variable using the assignment operator.

var myVar;
myVar = 5;
var myNum;
myNum = myVar;
The above declares a myVar variable with no value, then assigns it the value 5. Next, a variable named myNum is declared with no value. Then, the contents of myVar (which is 5) is assigned to the variable myNum. Now, myNum also has the value of 5.

---------------------------------------------------
Initializing Variables with the Assignment Operator
It is common to initialize a variable to an initial value in the same line as it is declared.

var myVar = 0;
Creates a new variable called myVar and assigns it an initial value of 0.

------------------------
Declare String Variables
Previously you used the following code to declare a variable:

var myName;
But you can also declare a string variable like this:

var myName = "your name";
"your name" is called a string literal. A string literal, or string, is a series of zero or more characters enclosed in single or double quotes.

-------------------------------------
Understanding Uninitialized Variables
When JavaScript variables are declared, they have an initial value of undefined. If you do a mathematical operation on an undefined variable your result will be NaN which means "Not a Number". If you concatenate a string with an undefined variable, you will get a string of undefined.

------------------------------------------
Understanding Case Sensitivity in Variables
In JavaScript all variables and function names are case sensitive. This means that capitalization matters.

MYVAR is not the same as MyVar nor myvar. It is possible to have multiple distinct variables with the same name but different casing. It is strongly recommended that for the sake of clarity, you do not use this language feature.

Best Practice

Write variable names in JavaScript in camelCase. In camelCase, multi-word variable names have the first word in lowercase and the first letter of each subsequent word is capitalized.

Examples:

var someVariable;
var anotherVariableName;
var thisVariableNameIsSoLong;

---------------------------------------------------
Explore Differences Between the var and let Keywords
One of the biggest problems with declaring variables with the var keyword is that you can easily overwrite variable declarations:

var camper = "James";
var camper = "David";
console.log(camper);
In the code above, the camper variable is originally declared as James, and is then overridden to be David. The console then displays the string David.

In a small application, you might not run into this type of problem. But as your codebase becomes larger, you might accidentally overwrite a variable that you did not intend to. Because this behavior does not throw an error, searching for and fixing bugs becomes more difficult.

A keyword called let was introduced in ES6, a major update to JavaScript, to solve this potential issue with the var keyword. You'll learn about other ES6 features in later challenges.

If you replace var with let in the code above, it results in an error:

let camper = "James";
let camper = "David";
The error can be seen in your browser console.

So unlike var, when you use let, a variable with the same name can only be declared once.

---------------------------------------------------
Declare a Read-Only Variable with the const Keyword
The keyword let is not the only new way to declare variables. In ES6, you can also declare variables using the const keyword.

const has all the awesome features that let has, with the added bonus that variables declared using const are read-only. They are a constant value, which means that once a variable is assigned with const, it cannot be reassigned:

const FAV_PET = "Cats";
FAV_PET = "Dogs";
The console will display an error due to reassigning the value of FAV_PET.

You should always name variables you don't want to reassign using the const keyword. This helps when you accidentally attempt to reassign a variable that is meant to stay constant.

Note: It is common for developers to use uppercase variable identifiers for immutable values and lowercase or camelCase for mutable values (objects and arrays). You will learn more about objects, arrays, and immutable and mutable values in later challenges. Also in later challenges, you will see examples of uppercase, lowercase, or camelCase variable identifiers.

-------------------------------
Add Two Numbers with JavaScript
Number is a data type in JavaScript which represents numeric data.

Now let's try to add two numbers using JavaScript.

JavaScript uses the + symbol as an addition operator when placed between two numbers.

Example:

const myVar = 5 + 10;
myVar now has the value 15.

------------------------------------------------
Subtract One Number from Another with JavaScript
We can also subtract one number from another.

JavaScript uses the - symbol for subtraction.

Example

const myVar = 12 - 6;
myVar would have the value 6.

------------------------------------
Multiply Two Numbers with JavaScript
We can also multiply one number by another.

JavaScript uses the * symbol for multiplication of two numbers.

Example

const myVar = 13 * 13;
myVar would have the value 169.

--------------------------------------------
Divide One Number by Another with JavaScript
We can also divide one number by another.

JavaScript uses the / symbol for division.

Example

const myVar = 16 / 2;
myVar now has the value 8.

----------------------------------
Increment a Number with JavaScript
You can easily increment or add one to a variable with the ++ operator.

i++;
is the equivalent of

i = i + 1;
Note: The entire line becomes i++;, eliminating the need for the equal sign.

----------------------------------
Decrement a Number with JavaScript
You can easily decrement or decrease a variable by one with the -- operator.

i--;
is the equivalent of

i = i - 1;
Note: The entire line becomes i--;, eliminating the need for the equal sign.

--------------------------------------
Create Decimal Numbers with JavaScript
We can store decimal numbers in variables too. Decimal numbers are sometimes referred to as floating point numbers or floats.

Note: when you compute numbers, they are computed with finite precision. Operations using floating points may lead to different results than the desired outcome. If you are getting one of these results, open a topic on the freeCodeCamp forum.

-------------------------------------
Multiply Two Decimals with JavaScript
In JavaScript, you can also perform calculations with decimal numbers, just like whole numbers.

Let's multiply two decimals together to get their product.

---------------------------------------------
Divide One Decimal by Another with JavaScript
Now let's divide one decimal by another.

---------------------------------
Finding a Remainder in JavaScript
The remainder operator % gives the remainder of the division of two numbers.

Example

5 % 2 = 1 because
Math.floor(5 / 2) = 2 (Quotient)
2 * 2 = 4
5 - 4 = 1 (Remainder)
Usage
In mathematics, a number can be checked to be even or odd by checking the remainder of the division of the number by 2.

17 % 2 = 1 (17 is Odd)
48 % 2 = 0 (48 is Even)
Note: The remainder operator is sometimes incorrectly referred to as the modulus operator. It is very similar to modulus, but does not work properly with negative numbers.


-------------------------------------------
Compound Assignment With Augmented Addition
In programming, it is common to use assignments to modify the contents of a variable. Remember that everything to the right of the equals sign is evaluated first, so we can say:

myVar = myVar + 5;
to add 5 to myVar. Since this is such a common pattern, there are operators which do both a mathematical operation and assignment in one step.

One such operator is the += operator.

let myVar = 1;
myVar += 5;
console.log(myVar);
6 would be displayed in the console.

----------------------------------------------
Compound Assignment With Augmented Subtraction
Like the += operator, -= subtracts a number from a variable.

myVar = myVar - 5;
will subtract 5 from myVar. This can be rewritten as:

myVar -= 5;

------------------------------------------------
Compound Assignment With Augmented Multiplication
The *= operator multiplies a variable by a number.

myVar = myVar * 5;
will multiply myVar by 5. This can be rewritten as:

myVar *= 5;

-------------------------------------------
Compound Assignment With Augmented Division
The /= operator divides a variable by another number.

myVar = myVar / 5;
Will divide myVar by 5. This can be rewritten as:

myVar /= 5;

----------------------------------
Escaping Literal Quotes in Strings
When you are defining a string you must start and end with a single or double quote. What happens when you need a literal quote: " or ' inside of your string?

In JavaScript, you can escape a quote from considering it as an end of string quote by placing a backslash (\) in front of the quote.

const sampleStr = "Alan said, \"Peter is learning JavaScript\".";
This signals to JavaScript that the following quote is not the end of the string, but should instead appear inside the string. So if you were to print this to the console, you would get:

Alan said, "Peter is learning JavaScript".

----------------------------------
Quoting Strings with Single Quotes
String values in JavaScript may be written with single or double quotes, as long as you start and end with the same type of quote. Unlike some other programming languages, single and double quotes work the same in JavaScript.

const doubleQuoteStr = "This is a string"; 
const singleQuoteStr = 'This is also a string';
The reason why you might want to use one type of quote over the other is if you want to use both in a string. This might happen if you want to save a conversation in a string and have the conversation in quotes. Another use for it would be saving an <a> tag with various attributes in quotes, all within a string.

const conversation = 'Finn exclaims to Jake, "Algebraic!"';
However, this becomes a problem if you need to use the outermost quotes within it. Remember, a string has the same kind of quote at the beginning and end. But if you have that same quote somewhere in the middle, the string will stop early and throw an error.

const goodStr = 'Jake asks Finn, "Hey, let\'s go on an adventure?"'; 
const badStr = 'Finn responds, "Let's go!"';
Here badStr will throw an error.

In the goodStr above, you can use both quotes safely by using the backslash \ as an escape character.

Note: The backslash \ should not be confused with the forward slash /. They do not do the same thing.

---------------------------
Escape Sequences in Strings
Quotes are not the only characters that can be escaped inside a string. There are two reasons to use escaping characters:

To allow you to use characters you may not otherwise be able to type out, such as a carriage return.
To allow you to represent multiple quotes in a string without JavaScript misinterpreting what you mean.
We learned this in the previous challenge.

Code	Output
\'	single quote
\"	double quote
\\	backslash
\n	newline
\r	carriage return
\t	tab
\b	word boundary
\f	form feed
Note that the backslash itself must be escaped in order to display as a backslash.

----------------------------------------
Concatenating Strings with Plus Operator
In JavaScript, when the + operator is used with a String value, it is called the concatenation operator. You can build a new string out of other strings by concatenating them together.

Example

'My name is Alan,' + ' I concatenate.'
Note: Watch out for spaces. Concatenation does not add spaces between concatenated strings, so you'll need to add them yourself.

Example:

const ourStr = "I come first. " + "I come second.";
The string I come first. I come second. would be displayed in the console.

---------------------------------------------------
Concatenating Strings with the Plus Equals Operator
We can also use the += operator to concatenate a string onto the end of an existing string variable. This can be very helpful to break a long string over several lines.

Note: Watch out for spaces. Concatenation does not add spaces between concatenated strings, so you'll need to add them yourself.

Example:

let ourStr = "I come first. ";
ourStr += "I come second.";
ourStr now has a value of the string I come first. I come second..

-----------------------------------
Constructing Strings with Variables
Sometimes you will need to build a string. By using the concatenation operator (+), you can insert one or more variables into a string you're building.

Example:

const ourName = "freeCodeCamp";
const ourStr = "Hello, our name is " + ourName + ", how are you?";
ourStr would have a value of the string Hello, our name is freeCodeCamp, how are you?.

------------------------------
Appending Variables to Strings
Just as we can build a string over multiple lines out of string literals, we can also append variables to a string using the plus equals (+=) operator.

Example:

const anAdjective = "awesome!";
let ourStr = "freeCodeCamp is ";
ourStr += anAdjective;
ourStr would have the value freeCodeCamp is awesome!.

---------------------------
Find the Length of a String
You can find the length of a String value by writing .length after the string variable or string literal.

console.log("Alan Peter".length);
The value 10 would be displayed in the console. Note that the space character between "Alan" and "Peter" is also counted.

For example, if we created a variable const firstName = "Ada", we could find out how long the string Ada is by using the firstName.length property.

------------------------------------------------------------
Use Bracket Notation to Find the First Character in a String
Bracket notation is a way to get a character at a specific index within a string.

Most modern programming languages, like JavaScript, don't start counting at 1 like humans do. They start at 0. This is referred to as Zero-based indexing.

For example, the character at index 0 in the word Charles is C. So if const firstName = "Charles", you can get the value of the first letter of the string by using firstName[0].

Example:

const firstName = "Charles";
const firstLetter = firstName[0];
firstLetter would have a value of the string C.

-------------------------------
Understand String Immutability
In JavaScript, String values are immutable, which means that they cannot be altered once created.

For example, the following code:

let myStr = "Bob";
myStr[0] = "J";
cannot change the value of myStr to Job, because the contents of myStr cannot be altered. Note that this does not mean that myStr cannot be changed, just that the individual characters of a string literal cannot be changed. The only way to change myStr would be to assign it with a new string, like this:

let myStr = "Bob";
myStr = "Job";

----------------------------------------------------------
Use Bracket Notation to Find the Nth Character in a String
You can also use bracket notation to get the character at other positions within a string.

Remember that computers start counting at 0, so the first character is actually the zeroth character.

Example:

const firstName = "Ada";
const secondLetterOfFirstName = firstName[1];
secondLetterOfFirstName would have a value of the string d.

------------------------------------------------------
Understand String Immutability
In JavaScript, String values are immutable, which means that they cannot be altered once created.

For example, the following code:

let myStr = "Bob";
myStr[0] = "J";
cannot change the value of myStr to Job, because the contents of myStr cannot be altered. Note that this does not mean that myStr cannot be changed, just that the individual characters of a string literal cannot be changed. The only way to change myStr would be to assign it with a new string, like this:

let myStr = "Bob";
myStr = "Job";

------------------------------------------------------
Use Bracket Notation to Find the Nth Character in a String
You can also use bracket notation to get the character at other positions within a string.

Remember that computers start counting at 0, so the first character is actually the zeroth character.

Example:

const firstName = "Ada";
const secondLetterOfFirstName = firstName[1];
secondLetterOfFirstName would have a value of the string d.

------------------------------------------------------
Use Bracket Notation to Find the Last Character in a String
In order to get the last letter of a string, you can subtract one from the string's length.

For example, if const firstName = "Ada", you can get the value of the last letter of the string by using firstName[firstName.length - 1].

Example:

const firstName = "Ada";
const lastLetter = firstName[firstName.length - 1];
lastLetter would have a value of the string a.

------------------------------------------------------
Use Bracket Notation to Find the Nth-to-Last Character in a String
You can use the same principle we just used to retrieve the last character in a string to retrieve the Nth-to-last character.

For example, you can get the value of the third-to-last letter of the const firstName = "Augusta" string by using firstName[firstName.length - 3]

Example:

const firstName = "Augusta";
const thirdToLastLetter = firstName[firstName.length - 3];
thirdToLastLetter would have a value of the string s.

------------------------------------------------------
Word Blanks
You are provided sentences with some missing words, like nouns, verbs, adjectives and adverbs. You then fill in the missing pieces with words of your choice in a way that the completed sentence makes sense.

Consider this sentence - It was really ____, and we ____ ourselves ____. This sentence has three missing pieces- an adjective, a verb and an adverb, and we can add words of our choice to complete it. We can then assign the completed sentence to a variable as follows:

const sentence = "It was really " + "hot" + ", and we " + "laughed" + " ourselves " + "silly" + ".";

------------------------------------------------------
Store Multiple Values in one Variable using JavaScript Arrays
With JavaScript array variables, we can store several pieces of data in one place.

You start an array declaration with an opening square bracket, end it with a closing square bracket, and put a comma between each entry, like this:

const sandwich = ["peanut butter", "jelly", "bread"];

------------------------------------------------------
Nest one Array within Another Array
You can also nest arrays within other arrays, like below:

const teams = [["Bulls", 23], ["White Sox", 45]];
This is also called a multi-dimensional array.

------------------------------------------------------
Access Array Data with Indexes
We can access the data inside arrays using indexes.

Array indexes are written in the same bracket notation that strings use, except that instead of specifying a character, they are specifying an entry in the array. Like strings, arrays use zero-based indexing, so the first element in an array has an index of 0.


Example

const array = [50, 60, 70];
console.log(array[0]);
const data = array[1];
The console.log(array[0]) prints 50, and data has the value 60.
------------------------------------------------------
Modify Array Data With Indexes
Unlike strings, the entries of arrays are mutable and can be changed freely, even if the array was declared with const.

Example

const ourArray = [50, 40, 30];
ourArray[0] = 15;
ourArray now has the value [15, 40, 30].

Note: There shouldn't be any spaces between the array name and the square brackets, like array [0]. Although JavaScript is able to process this correctly, this may confuse other programmers reading your code.

------------------------------------------------------
Access Multi-Dimensional Arrays With Indexes
One way to think of a multi-dimensional array, is as an array of arrays. When you use brackets to access your array, the first set of brackets refers to the entries in the outer-most (the first level) array, and each additional pair of brackets refers to the next level of entries inside.

Example

const arr = [
  [1, 2, 3],
  [4, 5, 6],
  [7, 8, 9],
  [[10, 11, 12], 13, 14]
];

arr[3];
arr[3][0];
arr[3][0][1];
arr[3] is [[10, 11, 12], 13, 14], arr[3][0] is [10, 11, 12], and arr[3][0][1] is 11.

Note: There shouldn't be any spaces between the array name and the square brackets, like array [0][0] and even this array [0] [0] is not allowed. Although JavaScript is able to process this correctly, this may confuse other programmers reading your code.

------------------------------------------------------
Manipulate Arrays With push()
An easy way to append data to the end of an array is via the push() function.

.push() takes one or more parameters and "pushes" them onto the end of the array.

Examples:

const arr1 = [1, 2, 3];
arr1.push(4);

const arr2 = ["Stimpson", "J", "cat"];
arr2.push(["happy", "joy"]);
arr1 now has the value [1, 2, 3, 4] and arr2 has the value ["Stimpson", "J", "cat", ["happy", "joy"]].

------------------------------------------------------
Manipulate Arrays With pop()
Another way to change the data in an array is with the .pop() function.

.pop() is used to pop a value off of the end of an array. We can store this popped off value by assigning it to a variable. In other words, .pop() removes the last element from an array and returns that element.

Any type of entry can be popped off of an array - numbers, strings, even nested arrays.

const threeArr = [1, 4, 6];
const oneDown = threeArr.pop();
console.log(oneDown);
console.log(threeArr);
The first console.log will display the value 6, and the second will display the value [1, 4].

------------------------------------------------------
Manipulate Arrays With shift()
pop() always removes the last element of an array. What if you want to remove the first?

That's where .shift() comes in. It works just like .pop(), except it removes the first element instead of the last.

Example:

const ourArray = ["Stimpson", "J", ["cat"]];
const removedFromOurArray = ourArray.shift();
removedFromOurArray would have a value of the string Stimpson, and ourArray would have ["J", ["cat"]].

------------------------------------------------------
Manipulate Arrays With unshift()
Not only can you shift elements off of the beginning of an array, you can also unshift elements to the beginning of an array i.e. add elements in front of the array.

.unshift() works exactly like .push(), but instead of adding the element at the end of the array, unshift() adds the element at the beginning of the array.

Example:

const ourArray = ["Stimpson", "J", "cat"];
ourArray.shift();
ourArray.unshift("Happy");
After the shift, ourArray would have the value ["J", "cat"]. After the unshift, ourArray would have the value ["Happy", "J", "cat"].

------------------------------------------------------
Shopping List
Create a shopping list in the variable myList. The list should be a multi-dimensional array containing several sub-arrays.

The first element in each sub-array should contain a string with the name of the item. The second element should be a number representing the quantity i.e.

["Chocolate Bar", 15]
There should be at least 5 sub-arrays in the list.

------------------------------------------------------
Write Reusable JavaScript with Functions
In JavaScript, we can divide up our code into reusable parts called functions.

Here's an example of a function:

function functionName() {
  console.log("Hello World");
}
You can call or invoke this function by using its name followed by parentheses, like this: functionName(); Each time the function is called it will print out the message Hello World on the dev console. All of the code between the curly braces will be executed every time the function is called.

------------------------------------------------------
Passing Values to Functions with Arguments
Parameters are variables that act as placeholders for the values that are to be input to a function when it is called. When a function is defined, it is typically defined along with one or more parameters. The actual values that are input (or "passed") into a function when it is called are known as arguments.

Here is a function with two parameters, param1 and param2:

function testFun(param1, param2) {
  console.log(param1, param2);
}
Then we can call testFun like this: testFun("Hello", "World");. We have passed two string arguments, Hello and World. Inside the function, param1 will equal the string Hello and param2 will equal the string World. Note that you could call testFun again with different arguments and the parameters would take on the value of the new arguments.

------------------------------------------------------
Return a Value from a Function with Return
We can pass values into a function with arguments. You can use a return statement to send a value back out of a function.

Example

function plusThree(num) {
  return num + 3;
}

const answer = plusThree(5);
answer has the value 8.

plusThree takes an argument for num and returns a value equal to num + 3.

------------------------------------------------------
Global Scope and Functions
In JavaScript, scope refers to the visibility of variables. Variables which are defined outside of a function block have Global scope. This means, they can be seen everywhere in your JavaScript code.

Variables which are declared without the let or const keywords are automatically created in the global scope. This can create unintended consequences elsewhere in your code or when running a function again. You should always declare your variables with let or const.

------------------------------------------------------
Local Scope and Functions
Variables which are declared within a function, as well as the function parameters, have local scope. That means they are only visible within that function.

Here is a function myTest with a local variable called loc.

function myTest() {
  const loc = "foo";
  console.log(loc);
}

myTest();
console.log(loc);
The myTest() function call will display the string foo in the console. The console.log(loc) line (outside of the myTest function) will throw an error, as loc is not defined outside of the function.

------------------------------------------------------
Global vs. Local Scope in Functions
It is possible to have both local and global variables with the same name. When you do this, the local variable takes precedence over the global variable.

In this example:

const someVar = "Hat";

function myFun() {
  const someVar = "Head";
  return someVar;
}
The function myFun will return the string Head because the local version of the variable is present.

------------------------------------------------------
Understanding Undefined Value returned from a Function
A function can include the return statement but it does not have to. In the case that the function doesn't have a return statement, when you call it, the function processes the inner code but the returned value is undefined.

Example

let sum = 0;

function addSum(num) {
  sum = sum + num;
}

addSum(3);
addSum is a function without a return statement. The function will change the global sum variable but the returned value of the function is undefined.

------------------------------------------------------
Assignment with a Returned Value
If you'll recall from our discussion about Storing Values with the Assignment Operator, everything to the right of the equal sign is resolved before the value is assigned. This means we can take the return value of a function and assign it to a variable.

Assume we have pre-defined a function sum which adds two numbers together, then:

ourSum = sum(5, 12);
will call the sum function, which returns a value of 17 and assigns it to the ourSum variable.

------------------------------------------------------
Stand in Line
In Computer Science a queue is an abstract Data Structure where items are kept in order. New items can be added at the back of the queue and old items are taken off from the front of the queue.

------------------------------------------------------
Understanding Boolean Values
Another data type is the Boolean. Booleans may only be one of two values: true or false. They are basically little on-off switches, where true is on and false is off. These two states are mutually exclusive.

Note: Boolean values are never written with quotes. The strings "true" and "false" are not Boolean and have no special meaning in JavaScript.

------------------------------------------------------
Use Conditional Logic with If Statements
if statements are used to make decisions in code. The keyword if tells JavaScript to execute the code in the curly braces under certain conditions, defined in the parentheses. These conditions are known as Boolean conditions and they may only be true or false.

When the condition evaluates to true, the program executes the statement inside the curly braces. When the Boolean condition evaluates to false, the statement inside the curly braces will not execute.

Pseudocode

if (condition is true) {
  statement is executed
}
Example

function test (myCondition) {
  if (myCondition) {
    return "It was true";
  }
  return "It was false";
}

test(true);
test(false);
test(true) returns the string It was true, and test(false) returns the string It was false.

When test is called with a value of true, the if statement evaluates myCondition to see if it is true or not. Since it is true, the function returns It was true. When we call test with a value of false, myCondition is not true and the statement in the curly braces is not executed and the function returns It was false.

------------------------------------------------------
Comparison with the Equality Operator
There are many comparison operators in JavaScript. All of these operators return a boolean true or false value.

The most basic operator is the equality operator ==. The equality operator compares two values and returns true if they're equivalent or false if they are not. Note that equality is different from assignment (=), which assigns the value on the right of the operator to a variable on the left.

function equalityTest(myVal) {
  if (myVal == 10) {
    return "Equal";
  }
  return "Not Equal";
}
If myVal is equal to 10, the equality operator returns true, so the code in the curly braces will execute, and the function will return Equal. Otherwise, the function will return Not Equal. In order for JavaScript to compare two different data types (for example, numbers and strings), it must convert one type to another. This is known as Type Coercion. Once it does, however, it can compare terms as follows:

1   ==  1  // true
1   ==  2  // false
1   == '1' // true
"3" ==  3  // true

------------------------------------------------------
Comparison with the Strict Equality Operator
Strict equality (===) is the counterpart to the equality operator (==). However, unlike the equality operator, which attempts to convert both values being compared to a common type, the strict equality operator does not perform a type conversion.

If the values being compared have different types, they are considered unequal, and the strict equality operator will return false.

Examples

3 ===  3  // true
3 === '3' // false
In the second example, 3 is a Number type and '3' is a String type.

------------------------------------------------------
Practice comparing different values
In the last two challenges, we learned about the equality operator (==) and the strict equality operator (===). Let's do a quick review and practice using these operators some more.

If the values being compared are not of the same type, the equality operator will perform a type conversion, and then evaluate the values. However, the strict equality operator will compare both the data type and value as-is, without converting one type to the other.

Examples

3 == '3' returns true because JavaScript performs type conversion from string to number. 3 === '3' returns false because the types are different and type conversion is not performed.

Note: In JavaScript, you can determine the type of a variable or a value with the typeof operator, as follows:

typeof 3
typeof '3'
typeof 3 returns the string number, and typeof '3' returns the string string.

------------------------------------------------------
Comparison with the Inequality Operator
The inequality operator (!=) is the opposite of the equality operator. It means not equal and returns false where equality would return true and vice versa. Like the equality operator, the inequality operator will convert data types of values while comparing.

Examples

1 !=  2    // true
1 != "1"   // false
1 != '1'   // false
1 != true  // false
0 != false // false

------------------------------------------------------
Comparison with the Strict Inequality Operator
The strict inequality operator (!==) is the logical opposite of the strict equality operator. It means "Strictly Not Equal" and returns false where strict equality would return true and vice versa. The strict inequality operator will not convert data types.

Examples

3 !==  3  // false
3 !== '3' // true
4 !==  3  // true

------------------------------------------------------
Comparison with the Greater Than Operator
The greater than operator (>) compares the values of two numbers. If the number to the left is greater than the number to the right, it returns true. Otherwise, it returns false.

Like the equality operator, the greater than operator will convert data types of values while comparing.

Examples

5   >  3  // true
7   > '3' // true
2   >  3  // false
'1' >  9  // false

------------------------------------------------------
Comparison with the Greater Than Or Equal To Operator
The greater than or equal to operator (>=) compares the values of two numbers. If the number to the left is greater than or equal to the number to the right, it returns true. Otherwise, it returns false.

Like the equality operator, the greater than or equal to operator will convert data types while comparing.

Examples

6   >=  6  // true
7   >= '3' // true
2   >=  3  // false
'7' >=  9  // false

------------------------------------------------------
Comparison with the Less Than Operator
The less than operator (<) compares the values of two numbers. If the number to the left is less than the number to the right, it returns true. Otherwise, it returns false. Like the equality operator, the less than operator converts data types while comparing.

Examples

2   < 5 // true
'3' < 7 // true
5   < 5 // false
3   < 2 // false
'8' < 4 // false
