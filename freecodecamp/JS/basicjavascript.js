JavaScript is a scripting language you can use to make web pages interactive. It is one of the core technologies of the web, along with HTML and CSS, and is supported by all modern browsers.

In this course, you'll learn fundamental programming concepts in JavaScript. You'll start with basic data structures like numbers and strings. Then you'll learn to work with arrays, objects, functions, loops, if/else statements, and more.

----------------------------
Comment Your JavaScript Code
Comments are lines of code that JavaScript will intentionally ignore. Comments are a great way to leave notes to yourself and to other people who will later need to figure out what that code does.

There are two ways to write comments in JavaScript:

Using // will tell JavaScript to ignore the remainder of the text on the current line. This is an in-line comment:

// This is an in-line comment.
You can make a multi-line comment beginning with /* and ending with */. This is a multi-line comment:

/* This is a
multi-line comment */
NOTE: As you write code, you should regularly add comments to clarify the function of parts of your code. Good commenting can help communicate the intent of your code—both for others and for your future self.

----------------------------
Declare JavaScript Variables
In computer science, data is anything that is meaningful to the computer. JavaScript provides eight different data types which are undefined, null, boolean, string, symbol, bigint, number, and object.

For example, computers distinguish between numbers, such as the number 12, and strings, such as "12", "dog", or "123 cats", which are collections of characters. Computers can perform mathematical operations on a number, but not on a string.

Variables allow computers to store and manipulate data in a dynamic fashion. They do this by using a "label" to point to the data rather than using the data itself. Any of the eight data types may be stored in a variable.

Variables are similar to the x and y variables you use in mathematics, which means they're a simple name to represent the data we want to refer to. Computer variables differ from mathematical variables in that they can store different values at different times.

We tell JavaScript to create or declare a variable by putting the keyword var in front of it, like so:

var ourName;
creates a variable called ourName. In JavaScript we end statements with semicolons. Variable names can be made up of numbers, letters, and $ or _, but may not contain spaces or start with a number.

----------------------------
Storing Values with the Assignment Operator
In JavaScript, you can store a value in a variable with the assignment operator (=).

myVariable = 5;
This assigns the Number value 5 to myVariable.

If there are any calculations to the right of the = operator, those are performed before the value is assigned to the variable on the left of the operator.

var myVar;
myVar = 5;
First, this code creates a variable named myVar. Then, the code assigns 5 to myVar. Now, if myVar appears again in the code, the program will treat it as if it is 5.

----------------------------------------------
Assigning the Value of One Variable to Another
After a value is assigned to a variable using the assignment operator, you can assign the value of that variable to another variable using the assignment operator.

var myVar;
myVar = 5;
var myNum;
myNum = myVar;
The above declares a myVar variable with no value, then assigns it the value 5. Next, a variable named myNum is declared with no value. Then, the contents of myVar (which is 5) is assigned to the variable myNum. Now, myNum also has the value of 5.

---------------------------------------------------
Initializing Variables with the Assignment Operator
It is common to initialize a variable to an initial value in the same line as it is declared.

var myVar = 0;
Creates a new variable called myVar and assigns it an initial value of 0.

------------------------
Declare String Variables
Previously you used the following code to declare a variable:

var myName;
But you can also declare a string variable like this:

var myName = "your name";
"your name" is called a string literal. A string literal, or string, is a series of zero or more characters enclosed in single or double quotes.

-------------------------------------
Understanding Uninitialized Variables
When JavaScript variables are declared, they have an initial value of undefined. If you do a mathematical operation on an undefined variable your result will be NaN which means "Not a Number". If you concatenate a string with an undefined variable, you will get a string of undefined.

------------------------------------------
Understanding Case Sensitivity in Variables
In JavaScript all variables and function names are case sensitive. This means that capitalization matters.

MYVAR is not the same as MyVar nor myvar. It is possible to have multiple distinct variables with the same name but different casing. It is strongly recommended that for the sake of clarity, you do not use this language feature.

Best Practice

Write variable names in JavaScript in camelCase. In camelCase, multi-word variable names have the first word in lowercase and the first letter of each subsequent word is capitalized.

Examples:

var someVariable;
var anotherVariableName;
var thisVariableNameIsSoLong;

---------------------------------------------------
Explore Differences Between the var and let Keywords
One of the biggest problems with declaring variables with the var keyword is that you can easily overwrite variable declarations:

var camper = "James";
var camper = "David";
console.log(camper);
In the code above, the camper variable is originally declared as James, and is then overridden to be David. The console then displays the string David.

In a small application, you might not run into this type of problem. But as your codebase becomes larger, you might accidentally overwrite a variable that you did not intend to. Because this behavior does not throw an error, searching for and fixing bugs becomes more difficult.

A keyword called let was introduced in ES6, a major update to JavaScript, to solve this potential issue with the var keyword. You'll learn about other ES6 features in later challenges.

If you replace var with let in the code above, it results in an error:

let camper = "James";
let camper = "David";
The error can be seen in your browser console.

So unlike var, when you use let, a variable with the same name can only be declared once.

---------------------------------------------------
Declare a Read-Only Variable with the const Keyword
The keyword let is not the only new way to declare variables. In ES6, you can also declare variables using the const keyword.

const has all the awesome features that let has, with the added bonus that variables declared using const are read-only. They are a constant value, which means that once a variable is assigned with const, it cannot be reassigned:

const FAV_PET = "Cats";
FAV_PET = "Dogs";
The console will display an error due to reassigning the value of FAV_PET.

You should always name variables you don't want to reassign using the const keyword. This helps when you accidentally attempt to reassign a variable that is meant to stay constant.

Note: It is common for developers to use uppercase variable identifiers for immutable values and lowercase or camelCase for mutable values (objects and arrays). You will learn more about objects, arrays, and immutable and mutable values in later challenges. Also in later challenges, you will see examples of uppercase, lowercase, or camelCase variable identifiers.

-------------------------------
Add Two Numbers with JavaScript
Number is a data type in JavaScript which represents numeric data.

Now let's try to add two numbers using JavaScript.

JavaScript uses the + symbol as an addition operator when placed between two numbers.

Example:

const myVar = 5 + 10;
myVar now has the value 15.

------------------------------------------------
Subtract One Number from Another with JavaScript
We can also subtract one number from another.

JavaScript uses the - symbol for subtraction.

Example

const myVar = 12 - 6;
myVar would have the value 6.

------------------------------------
Multiply Two Numbers with JavaScript
We can also multiply one number by another.

JavaScript uses the * symbol for multiplication of two numbers.

Example

const myVar = 13 * 13;
myVar would have the value 169.

--------------------------------------------
Divide One Number by Another with JavaScript
We can also divide one number by another.

JavaScript uses the / symbol for division.

Example

const myVar = 16 / 2;
myVar now has the value 8.

----------------------------------
Increment a Number with JavaScript
You can easily increment or add one to a variable with the ++ operator.

i++;
is the equivalent of

i = i + 1;
Note: The entire line becomes i++;, eliminating the need for the equal sign.

----------------------------------
Decrement a Number with JavaScript
You can easily decrement or decrease a variable by one with the -- operator.

i--;
is the equivalent of

i = i - 1;
Note: The entire line becomes i--;, eliminating the need for the equal sign.

--------------------------------------
Create Decimal Numbers with JavaScript
We can store decimal numbers in variables too. Decimal numbers are sometimes referred to as floating point numbers or floats.

Note: when you compute numbers, they are computed with finite precision. Operations using floating points may lead to different results than the desired outcome. If you are getting one of these results, open a topic on the freeCodeCamp forum.

-------------------------------------
Multiply Two Decimals with JavaScript
In JavaScript, you can also perform calculations with decimal numbers, just like whole numbers.

Let's multiply two decimals together to get their product.

---------------------------------------------
Divide One Decimal by Another with JavaScript
Now let's divide one decimal by another.

---------------------------------
Finding a Remainder in JavaScript
The remainder operator % gives the remainder of the division of two numbers.

Example

5 % 2 = 1 because
Math.floor(5 / 2) = 2 (Quotient)
2 * 2 = 4
5 - 4 = 1 (Remainder)
Usage
In mathematics, a number can be checked to be even or odd by checking the remainder of the division of the number by 2.

17 % 2 = 1 (17 is Odd)
48 % 2 = 0 (48 is Even)
Note: The remainder operator is sometimes incorrectly referred to as the modulus operator. It is very similar to modulus, but does not work properly with negative numbers.


-------------------------------------------
Compound Assignment With Augmented Addition
In programming, it is common to use assignments to modify the contents of a variable. Remember that everything to the right of the equals sign is evaluated first, so we can say:

myVar = myVar + 5;
to add 5 to myVar. Since this is such a common pattern, there are operators which do both a mathematical operation and assignment in one step.

One such operator is the += operator.

let myVar = 1;
myVar += 5;
console.log(myVar);
6 would be displayed in the console.

----------------------------------------------
Compound Assignment With Augmented Subtraction
Like the += operator, -= subtracts a number from a variable.

myVar = myVar - 5;
will subtract 5 from myVar. This can be rewritten as:

myVar -= 5;

------------------------------------------------
Compound Assignment With Augmented Multiplication
The *= operator multiplies a variable by a number.

myVar = myVar * 5;
will multiply myVar by 5. This can be rewritten as:

myVar *= 5;

-------------------------------------------
Compound Assignment With Augmented Division
The /= operator divides a variable by another number.

myVar = myVar / 5;
Will divide myVar by 5. This can be rewritten as:

myVar /= 5;

----------------------------------
Escaping Literal Quotes in Strings
When you are defining a string you must start and end with a single or double quote. What happens when you need a literal quote: " or ' inside of your string?

In JavaScript, you can escape a quote from considering it as an end of string quote by placing a backslash (\) in front of the quote.

const sampleStr = "Alan said, \"Peter is learning JavaScript\".";
This signals to JavaScript that the following quote is not the end of the string, but should instead appear inside the string. So if you were to print this to the console, you would get:

Alan said, "Peter is learning JavaScript".

----------------------------------
Quoting Strings with Single Quotes
String values in JavaScript may be written with single or double quotes, as long as you start and end with the same type of quote. Unlike some other programming languages, single and double quotes work the same in JavaScript.

const doubleQuoteStr = "This is a string"; 
const singleQuoteStr = 'This is also a string';
The reason why you might want to use one type of quote over the other is if you want to use both in a string. This might happen if you want to save a conversation in a string and have the conversation in quotes. Another use for it would be saving an <a> tag with various attributes in quotes, all within a string.

const conversation = 'Finn exclaims to Jake, "Algebraic!"';
However, this becomes a problem if you need to use the outermost quotes within it. Remember, a string has the same kind of quote at the beginning and end. But if you have that same quote somewhere in the middle, the string will stop early and throw an error.

const goodStr = 'Jake asks Finn, "Hey, let\'s go on an adventure?"'; 
const badStr = 'Finn responds, "Let's go!"';
Here badStr will throw an error.

In the goodStr above, you can use both quotes safely by using the backslash \ as an escape character.

Note: The backslash \ should not be confused with the forward slash /. They do not do the same thing.

---------------------------
Escape Sequences in Strings
Quotes are not the only characters that can be escaped inside a string. There are two reasons to use escaping characters:

To allow you to use characters you may not otherwise be able to type out, such as a carriage return.
To allow you to represent multiple quotes in a string without JavaScript misinterpreting what you mean.
We learned this in the previous challenge.

Code	Output
\'	single quote
\"	double quote
\\	backslash
\n	newline
\r	carriage return
\t	tab
\b	word boundary
\f	form feed
Note that the backslash itself must be escaped in order to display as a backslash.

----------------------------------------
Concatenating Strings with Plus Operator
In JavaScript, when the + operator is used with a String value, it is called the concatenation operator. You can build a new string out of other strings by concatenating them together.

Example

'My name is Alan,' + ' I concatenate.'
Note: Watch out for spaces. Concatenation does not add spaces between concatenated strings, so you'll need to add them yourself.

Example:

const ourStr = "I come first. " + "I come second.";
The string I come first. I come second. would be displayed in the console.

---------------------------------------------------
Concatenating Strings with the Plus Equals Operator
We can also use the += operator to concatenate a string onto the end of an existing string variable. This can be very helpful to break a long string over several lines.

Note: Watch out for spaces. Concatenation does not add spaces between concatenated strings, so you'll need to add them yourself.

Example:

let ourStr = "I come first. ";
ourStr += "I come second.";
ourStr now has a value of the string I come first. I come second..

-----------------------------------
Constructing Strings with Variables
Sometimes you will need to build a string. By using the concatenation operator (+), you can insert one or more variables into a string you're building.

Example:

const ourName = "freeCodeCamp";
const ourStr = "Hello, our name is " + ourName + ", how are you?";
ourStr would have a value of the string Hello, our name is freeCodeCamp, how are you?.

------------------------------
Appending Variables to Strings
Just as we can build a string over multiple lines out of string literals, we can also append variables to a string using the plus equals (+=) operator.

Example:

const anAdjective = "awesome!";
let ourStr = "freeCodeCamp is ";
ourStr += anAdjective;
ourStr would have the value freeCodeCamp is awesome!.

---------------------------
Find the Length of a String
You can find the length of a String value by writing .length after the string variable or string literal.

console.log("Alan Peter".length);
The value 10 would be displayed in the console. Note that the space character between "Alan" and "Peter" is also counted.

For example, if we created a variable const firstName = "Ada", we could find out how long the string Ada is by using the firstName.length property.

------------------------------------------------------------
Use Bracket Notation to Find the First Character in a String
Bracket notation is a way to get a character at a specific index within a string.

Most modern programming languages, like JavaScript, don't start counting at 1 like humans do. They start at 0. This is referred to as Zero-based indexing.

For example, the character at index 0 in the word Charles is C. So if const firstName = "Charles", you can get the value of the first letter of the string by using firstName[0].

Example:

const firstName = "Charles";
const firstLetter = firstName[0];
firstLetter would have a value of the string C.

-------------------------------
Understand String Immutability
In JavaScript, String values are immutable, which means that they cannot be altered once created.

For example, the following code:

let myStr = "Bob";
myStr[0] = "J";
cannot change the value of myStr to Job, because the contents of myStr cannot be altered. Note that this does not mean that myStr cannot be changed, just that the individual characters of a string literal cannot be changed. The only way to change myStr would be to assign it with a new string, like this:

let myStr = "Bob";
myStr = "Job";

----------------------------------------------------------
Use Bracket Notation to Find the Nth Character in a String
You can also use bracket notation to get the character at other positions within a string.

Remember that computers start counting at 0, so the first character is actually the zeroth character.

Example:

const firstName = "Ada";
const secondLetterOfFirstName = firstName[1];
secondLetterOfFirstName would have a value of the string d.
